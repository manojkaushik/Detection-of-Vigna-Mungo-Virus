# Detection-of-Vigna-Mungo-Virus using deep CNN Network

## Description
This work proposes an automatic deep-learning-based viral infection detection method for a leguminous plant, Vigna mungo which is grown largely in the Indian subcontinent. Due to viral infection, some properties of the leaf image changes but the pattern is very random throughout the leaf structure. Hence, it is quite challenging to make an automatic disease detection method and perform the detection tasks in real-time. The collected image dataset of Vigna mungo leaves belonging to different categories are segmented and augmented to introduce more variety in the leaf image dataset.
